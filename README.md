# Blog AggreGATOR üêä

**Gator**üêä is a simple Go-based CLI blog aggregator that allows users to:

- Add RSS feeds from across the internet to be collected
- Store the collected posts in a PostgreSQL database
- Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
- View summaries of the aggregated posts in the terminal, with a link to the full post

*Note that there's no secure authentication system available (at least for now). This means that user registration is implemented by simply setting a username.*
